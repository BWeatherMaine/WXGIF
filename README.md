#Weather GIFs

This project generates GIFs of NWS radar images and auto tweets them hourly. Currently only tweeting GIFs of the northeast at the twitter handle [@wxGIF](http://twitter.com/wxgif).

Very much a work in progress. Feel free to pull and contribute or clone and use it yourself!

##Next Steps

1. Abstract/clean code for other users
2. Document steps from clone to tweet
3. Create twitter account for each region
3. Only tweet when some threshold of activity
4. Get working with individual radar stations
5. Change base map + projection
6. Change color palette.
7. Incorporate warnings/watches
